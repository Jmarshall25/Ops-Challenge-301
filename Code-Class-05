# Main

# Create a timestamp in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
timestamp=$(date "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

# Specify the backup directory
backup_dir="/var/log/backups"

# Create the backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $backup_dir

# Loop through the log files to be backed up
for file in /var/log/syslog /var/log/wtmp; do

  # Get the original size of the file
  orig_size=$(du -h $file | awk '{print $1}')

  # Create a filename for the compressed backup file
  zip_file="$backup_dir/$(basename $file)-$timestamp.zip"

  # Compress the file and save it to the backup directory with the specified filename
  zip -q $zip_file $file

  # Clear the contents of the log file
  > $file

  # Get the size of the compressed backup file
  zip_size=$(du -h $zip_file | awk '{print $1}')

  # Print the file size and compressed file size to the screen
  echo "Original file size of $file: $orig_size"
  echo "Compressed file size of $zip_file: $zip_size"

  # Compare the original and compressed file sizes and print a message indicating which one is larger or smaller
  if [[ $orig_size < $zip_size ]]; then
    echo "The compressed file is larger than the original file."
  elif [[ $orig_size > $zip_size ]]; then
    echo "The compressed file is smaller than the original file."
  else
    echo "The compressed file is the same size as the original file."
